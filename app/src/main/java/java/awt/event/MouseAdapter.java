/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving mouse events. The methods in this class are empty. This
 * class exists as convenience for creating listener objects.
 * <p>
 * Mouse events let you track when a mouse is pressed, released, clicked, moved, dragged, when it
 * enters a component, when it exits and when a mouse wheel is moved.
 * <p>
 * Extend this class to create a {@code MouseEvent} (including drag and motion events) or/and {@code
 * MouseWheelEvent} listener and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement
 * the {@code MouseListener}, {@code MouseMotionListener} interface, you have to define all of the
 * methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them all, so you can only have to
 * define methods for events you care about.)
 * <p>
 * Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with a component using the
 * component's {@code addMouseListener} {@code addMouseMotionListener}, {@code
 * addMouseWheelListener} methods. The relevant method in the listener object is invoked  and the
 * {@code MouseEvent} or {@code MouseWheelEvent}  is passed to it in following cases: <ul> <li>when
 * a mouse button is pressed, released, or clicked (pressed and  released) <li>when the mouse cursor
 * enters or exits the component <li>when the mouse wheel rotated, or mouse moved or dragged </ul>
